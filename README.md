**KDE/krita github repository : krita/master branch**

In my environment, KDE's repositories are horribly slow, so **I use a mirror on github instead.**<br>
It takes 2-3 hours to build each Krita versions. I don't have a CI/CD system, so **this repository may not keep up with "daily" builds.**<br>
If you want to get the "latest" nightly build, download AppImage or build your own.
